Subject: Re: VT220 Font license for open source project?
To: Tad Hunt

Hi Tad!

The font should be treated as public domain I think. I get this question
asked every now and then and I just say public domain.

My first green glow was of a Soviet clone of VT-52. There's something truly
magical about those old monochrome CRT screens eh..

Cheers,
Viacheslav
